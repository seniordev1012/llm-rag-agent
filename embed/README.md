# AnythingLLM Embedded Chat Widget

> [!WARNING]
> The use of the AnythingLLM embed is currently in beta. Please request a feature or
> report a bug via a Github Issue if you have any issues.

> [!WARNING]
> The core AnythingLLM team publishes a pre-built version of the script that is bundled
> with the main application. You can find it at the frontend URL `/embed/anythingllm-chat-widget.min.js`.
> You should only be working in this repo if you are wanting to build your own custom embed.

This folder of AnythingLLM contains the source code for how the embedded version of AnythingLLM works to provide a public facing interface of your workspace.

The AnythingLLM Embedded chat widget allows you to expose a workspace and its embedded knowledge base as a chat bubble via a `<script>` or `<iframe>` element that you can embed in a website or HTML.

### Security
- Users will _not_ be able to view or read context snippets like they can in the core AnythingLLM application
- Users are assigned a random session ID that they use to persist a chat session.
- **Recommended** You can limit both the number of chats an embedding can process **and** per-session. 

_by using the AnythingLLM embedded chat widget you are responsible for securing and configuration of the embed as to not allow excessive chat model abuse of your instance_

### Developer Setup
- `cd embed` from the root of the repo
- `yarn` to install all dev and script dependencies
- `yarn dev` to boot up an example HTML page to use the chat embed widget.

While in development mode (`yarn dev`) the script will rebuild on any changes to files in the `src` directory. Ensure that the required keys for the development embed are accurate and set.

`yarn build` will compile and minify your build of the script. You can then host and link your built script wherever you like.

## Integrations & Embed Types

### `<script>` tag HTML embed

The primary way of embedding a workspace as a chat widget is via a simple `<script>`
```html
<!-- 
An example of a script tag embed
REQUIRED data attributes:
  data-embed-id // The unique id of your embed with its default settings
  data-base-api-url // The URL of your anythingLLM instance backend
-->
<script 
  data-embed-id="5fc05aaf-2f2c-4c84-87a3-367a4692c1ee"
  data-base-api-url="http://localhost:3001/api/embed"
  src="http://localhost:3000/embed/anythingllm-chat-widget.min.js">
</script>
```
